In my next project I wanted to do something that was both interesting to me and would provide a challenge. So as I have recently dug out my old GameBoy colour I decided to create a simple pokedex. 

In this app I wanted add couple of features and use only vanilla javascript. I wanted to look at a fetch function to bring in an api but also use simple css to make it look as close to a pokedex as possible.

Please have a look here:
