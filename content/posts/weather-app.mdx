This was one of the first projects I completed with manchester Codes and was a real eye opener on the power of React within applications.

The concepts we were using within this application were: React, JSX, Props, State, Stateless components, Enzyme and request and response with axios. 

I really got to grips with error handling within this task and learning to search and fix code with a few techniques, the best way to look at this was to be positive you had solved one issue and was on to the next.
