I wanted to try something slightly different with this project and something that I thought would be a little bit fun.

It taught me things such as sprite placement as as well as keyboard input and frame-rate optimization.

I downloaded some sprite sheets from a website online and implemented them into my project.

The main issue I overcame in this task was the collision element and making sure the objects collided with the frog in the right areas.

Please have a look here and let me know your high score:
