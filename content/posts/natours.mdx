This is my current project that I am working on.

In this project I am looking at improving my CSS and Sass skills to create more of a refined and usable webpage.

I have currently added sass to the repository and am currently trying to make the page more responsive

I am using a tutorial on udemy to help me along with a number of web articles.

Please have a look here:
