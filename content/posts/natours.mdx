Recently I have been going to a number of meet ups around Manchester and when networking I always hear the same thing from the developers "I can't do CSS" or "I hate CSS"... So I thought from this, hey maybe I should get better at CSS as if everyone hates it maybe I could make this my niche.

So with this though in my mind I decided to delve deeper into the world of CSS. I decided to make an website using advanced CSS techniques and SASS and hopefully I won't be one of the many CSS hating developers out there.

In this project I am mainly looking at improving my CSS and Sass skills to create more of a refined and usable webpage.

I have currently added sass to the repository and am currently trying to make the page more responsive

I am using a tutorial on udemy to help me along with a number of web articles.
