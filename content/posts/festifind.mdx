This was a group project in which i wanted to integrate a number of API's to improve the applications functionality

In this project I integrated a search function into a geolocator which connected to a skiddle API to show all the festival data within the location.

There was a number of axios posts within this challenge and a lot of understanding where to implement state and props.

I spent a while on the CSS behind this page and was happy with how it came out looking including the product page and search bar itself.
