This was a fun project me and 3 others did to enter the Hac100, a 24 hour hackathon in which we came second in the junior category.

We were given the task of creating something of value to users using the clockwork API and a language of our choice (Javascript).

Our idea was to provide accessability to all and create a notification app in which you can input your disabilities and it comes up with events in the local area available to you. This was helped as within the clockwork API there was a number of accessible data such as events and you would easy input data into a local database, such as users information and details.

We gave this challenge a fair go and I'm pleased with the results considering no sleep and looking to learn new functions along the way,
